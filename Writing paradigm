# Writing paradigm

- diminishing returns in many tasks; try to do tasks a speed that gives you a sense of things moving forward, mistakes won't feel as mistakey if the effort involved was swift
- use sentences with ; for variation
- methods vs tools? Methods in non-technical parts, function in materials & methods
- object vs instance? Instance
- data structure vs data container?
- health outcomes
