**The braindump is a repository for the fleeting thoughts that further the project at hand but are better picked up at a later stage.**

Packages of interest that interface with singlecellexperiment: scater, scran, clusterExperiment,  

# Writing paradigm
- diminishing returns in many tasks; try to do tasks a speed that gives you a sense of things moving forward, mistakes won't feel as mistakey if the effort involved was swift
- use sentences with ; for variation
- methods vs tools? Methods in non-technical parts, function in materials & methods
- object vs instance? Instance
- data structure vs data container?


If using the Hintikka XO-data, Notame functionalities for multi-modal metabolomic LC/MS and microbiome analysis are of interest. What are some examples of these?  How far does one need to go in the workflow?
- The HintikkaXO dataset contains high-throughput profiling data from 40 rat samples, including 39 biomarkers, 38 metabolites (NMR), and 12706 OTUs from 318 species. It is a diet comparison study with High/Low fat diet and xylo-oligosaccaride supplementation.

- Visualizations, yes
- Time series, no
- Two groups, yes (combination of Fat and XOS factors)
- Two categorical study factors, yes (Low/high fat, 0/1 XOS diet supplement)
- Associations between molecular features and other variables, yes
