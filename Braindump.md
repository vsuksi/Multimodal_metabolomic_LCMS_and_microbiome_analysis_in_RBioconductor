Skip the LC/MS in the title, as Hintikka metabolite data is by NMR?

No mention of LC/MS in Hintikka?

How to filter Bioconductor metabolomics packages of interest?

If using the Hintikka XO-data, Notame functionalities for multi-modal metabolomic LC/MS and microbiome analysis are of interest. What are some examples of these?  How far does one need to go in the workflow?
- The HintikkaXO dataset contains high-throughput profiling data from 40 rat samples, including 39 biomarkers, 38 metabolites (NMR), and 12706 OTUs from 318 species. It is a diet comparison study with High/Low fat diet and xylo-oligosaccaride supplementation.

- Visualizations, yes
- Time series, no
- Two groups, yes (combination of Fat and XOS factors)
- Two categorical study factors, yes (Low/high fat, 0/1 XOS diet supplement)
- Associations between molecular features and other variables, yes
