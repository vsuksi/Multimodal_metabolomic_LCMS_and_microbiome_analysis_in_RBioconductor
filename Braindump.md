# Notes from Notame paper

The metabolic profiling workflow involves numerous steps that require expertise in analytical chemistry, biochemistry, bioinformatics and data analysis.

The acquired data needs to undergo several preprocessing steps, starting from data collection (peak picking), where it is imperative to understand the detection threshold and signal-to-noise ratios of the measurement. This is then followed by a multi-step processing phase involving imputation, normalization, data reduction and clean-up, which determines the quality of the data that is used in downstream data-analysis, metabolite identification and biological interpretation of the results.
